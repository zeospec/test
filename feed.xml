        <title>Car Swachbins</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rotaract Bangalore Junction partnered with MYM for their Event no. 31- an awareness and community service project “Car Swachbin”. With successfully conducted 30 events; distributing 22,000 bins in Bangalore, 65,000 bins across India and they are the official ambassadors of Swach Bharat Abhiyaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We distributed 100 eco-friendly, reusable car bins to private car owners to prevent littering on roads. Car owners were appreciative of the idea and forthcoming to contribute for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The outcome of the project was fun for all members and some of them even had a breakthrough of being able to make a short conversation with a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special mention for Rtn. Siddharth Hamirwasia from Rotary Bangalore Junction for being there and supporting the cause with us. As a part of Swach Bharat Abhiyan we have helped raise awareness about the need for cleanliness and acted upon it by providing them with the car bins.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Art Appreciation Heritage Walk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I suppose we have a lot of reasons to be happy or bitter in life. But one can hang on that life’s filled with different experience and some of us consider to experience among special people. As we welcome our specially challenged children on a Saturday morning to the National Art Gallery we saw children being enthusiastic with their huge smile and arms held out to shake their hands and tell their names. It was surely going to be a memorable experience for each one us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walked past the permanent collection of the museum which brought light to the ancient art and depiction of animals, which was remarkable as children were overwhelmed to identify the animals. As we made our way to look at the finest pieces of art, children was made to sit in front of a huge painting and was given an art kit to spend time to visualise and express their art work. Children portrayed explicit pieces of elusive art works which were filled with imagination and colour. They portrayed their creativity which brought a sense of feeling of accomplishment and overwhelming pride on each of their face. This made us feel that art is the product of creative human expression and bringing a feeling of satisfaction as we saw their achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/riy18-19-artappreciation2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Art Appreciation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this feeling of enjoyment we headed to have lunch. It was that time of the day to bid farewell, but not before they entertained us by singing and dancing. We sat there, delighted and one cannot express the feeling of happiness by watching their beauty of art.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Painting of a School</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Painting of a School with Rotaract Club of Vijayanagar, painting projects are one that always seems to get us excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we had 6 members and 2 prospective members who took part in this event. It was great fun, splashing colours on the walls and on ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through that heat, we managed to enrich one portion of the school wall with our artistic skills.&lt;/p&gt;
