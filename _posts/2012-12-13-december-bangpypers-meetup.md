Started a discussion on the bangalore.python.org.in website. The points that came up are. 

General 
=======
1. Conduct community projects - Bangpypers can spearhead projects which the local user group can work on. 


Site suggestions
================

1. Root the blog at `bangalore.python.org.in/blog` and then by date e.g. This entry would be `bangalore.python.org.in/blog/2012/12/15/december_metup.html`.
2. We need a subscribe link on the website. 
3. We need an embedded "recent Bangpypers mail threads" widget on the site.
4. Design love. The site needs a lot of of design love. There were some suggestions from the audience. The plan is for the interested parties (Sidharth) to send mockups to the mailing list. 
5. We need a college catalogue (like the Pune company catalogue).
6. We need a member roster. 
7. Take appropriate steps to rename the @pyconindia twitter account and use @pythonindia for all notifications of user group meetups and everything else.
