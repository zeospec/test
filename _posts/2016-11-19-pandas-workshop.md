The [November BangPypers workshop](http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/235076152/) happened at the [Clear Tax](http://cleartax.in/) office in Hongasandra.

The workshop was an introduction to pandas. The presenters were [Bargava](https://twitter.com/bargava) and [Amit Kapoor](https://twitter.com/amitkaps).

Workshop was started at 9 O clock. First half of the workshop was theory. They started with a brief explanation about data analysis and why it is required. There was a discussion about the real life examples of data analysis. Then they showed how to use Jupyter notebook and explained the basics. There was break for about 10 minutes.

After resuming from break, they started explained about using pandas with imdb dataset. They explained several operations that can be performed on dataframes. Later they gave several exercises to participants to refine, transform and model data.
