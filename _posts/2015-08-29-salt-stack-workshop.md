We had [workshop](http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/223389765/) on [salt stack](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/contents.html) at RedHat office. Workshop was attended by 30 people.
Previously we had done workshop with Django, Data Visualization and this time it was on automation and configuration management. This is very niche area. We had 35 participants. Workshop had very light content. Workshop content can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/madhavan020985/bangpy-aug-saltstack).
