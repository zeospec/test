The [December BangPypers meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/160108032/) happened at the [APIGee][] office in Kormanagala. This time we didn't have workshops or talks but dev sprint.

The agenda was to contribute to open source projects. There were 53 participants. The event started with introduction about projects participants would like to work on. The participants were mix of beginners and experienced contributors. We had 5 mentors, [Baiju][], [Sayan][], [Siva][], [Elvis][], [Krace][].
