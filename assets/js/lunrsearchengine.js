With successfully conducted 30 events; distributing 22,000 bins in Bangalore, 65,000 bins across India and they are the official ambassadors of Swach Bharat Abhiyaan. We distributed 100 eco-friendly, reusable car bins to private car owners to prevent littering on roads. Car owners were appreciative of the idea and forthcoming to contribute for the same. The outcome of the project was fun for all members and some of them even had a breakthrough of being able to make a short conversation with a stranger. A special mention for Rtn. Siddharth Hamirwasia from Rotary Bangalore Junction for being there and supporting the cause with us. As a part of Swach Bharat Abhiyan we have helped raise awareness about the need for cleanliness and acted upon it by providing them with the car bins. Check here for more details: Instagram "

    "body": "2019/04/27 - I suppose we have a lot of reasons to be happy or bitter in life. But one can hang on that life’s filled with different experience and some of us consider to experience among special people. As we welcome our specially challenged children on a Saturday morning to the National Art Gallery we saw children being enthusiastic with their huge smile and arms held out to shake their hands and tell their names. It was surely going to be a memorable experience for each one us. Walked past the permanent collection of the museum which brought light to the ancient art and depiction of animals, which was remarkable as children were overwhelmed to identify the animals. As we made our way to look at the finest pieces of art, children was made to sit in front of a huge painting and was given an art kit to spend time to visualise and express their art work. Children portrayed explicit pieces of elusive art works which were filled with imagination and colour. They portrayed their creativity which brought a sense of feeling of accomplishment and overwhelming pride on each of their face. This made us feel that art is the product of creative human expression and bringing a feeling of satisfaction as we saw their achievement.  With this feeling of enjoyment we headed to have lunch. It was that time of the day to bid farewell, but not before they entertained us by singing and dancing. We sat there, delighted and one cannot express the feeling of happiness by watching their beauty of art. "

Our Government setting out to give two drops of Oral Polio vaccine to every child in our country under the age of five. The Rotary and Rotract Club of Bangalore were keen participants and were put to the task of handling two centres – Manvarthpet Maternity Home in Chikpet and Magadi Road Maternity Centre. After a small inauguration (lighting of a lamp) at the Chikpet facility we headed to an auspicious temple where one of the Polio Booths were set up. Post which we volunteered to assist the nurses in giving, marking and keeping a count of the number of young children vaccinated at the centre. Our enthusiastic rotractors divided into two teams of three or four set out at different corners of Chikpet carrying the vaccines in an ice box along with a marker and a head count sheet to convince as many parents we could spot to immunize their young toddlers. It was quite a challenge as some children were scared, stubborn and the slightly older ones did throw quite a tantrum. Credit to the well behaved ones as they deserved an extra bite of candy chocolates from our side. On the streets of busy, bustling, chaotic, commercial Chikpet we were successfully able to vaccinate close to a 100 children. It was quite a relief to some of the parents and they were thankful that we approached them at the right time. Back at the maternity centre we were able to vaccinate over 300 children and Iam sure numbers continued to soar the rest of the day. This warm sunny Sunday was well spent and extremely satisfying as we all have the same aim in life as many others, to continue and strive to make India a Polio Free Country.  A big Thank you to our President Mr. Vivek Prabhu, Ram Sheshu all the board and inner wheel members. Huge shout out to our Secretary Joseph Wilson, I admire your passion, drive and dedication, thank you Rotractor Amit, Deepan and a big round of applause to all the volunteers who took the time out to participate in this ground breaking project.

Emphasizing the need to believe in their dream and the power to think ““I can”” was the aspect of ‘I am a winner program’. It is rightly said that ‘You yourself need to protect your dreams and don’t let anyone curb your interest’. Therefore , a short program was curated to interact with the class, to know their dreams and the steps taken to achieve their goals by developing the characteristics required to achieve their success. There is no better way than to spend a Saturday and we were overwhelmed to see their eyes filled with dreams and their responsibility to achieve them. Ryla program is one of the best program that we have attended which helped us to not only spend our day among kids but also to understand that life needs to be indulged with hope, sharing and believing. Special thanks to Rtn. Meera Mam, RaC Baldwin Women’s Methodist College, RaC Presidency College, RaC SSMRV College &amp; RaC Vijaynagar for joining us and making this Project a successful one. "

We distributed drawing sheets, crayons, and other drawing materials and asked them to draw whatever they pleased. They drew huts and hills, chaps and choppers. Watching them do it all with so much enthusiasm, gave us a tingling sense of satisfaction. We spoke to them about what they like to do and what they wanted to become. I must say, they were one ambitious bunch. Just listening to them talk, made us smile. We later distributed some snacks. They all patiently waited till everybody received their share, and once they did, they began to pray in synchronisation. It taught us all to be grateful. We provided them with books and other stationery items they required at school. We also distributed bubbles which we were all thrilled to play with. We sang together and had a hearty time. For a first event, it was perfect. We had a beautiful experience and hope to continue spending more time with them. "
